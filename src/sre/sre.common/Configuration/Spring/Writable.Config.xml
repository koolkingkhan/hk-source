	<!-- 
		Because of the issues with ADT when we write back into the App.Config file,
		we need to separate "writable" sections from this file. This means that whenever
		we wish to write back changes to our "pseudo" App.Config file, ADT will not detect this
		as a change and re-download
    
    Instructions
    ************
    
    1) Add writable parameters to this file
    2) Update the relevant Handler to process these properties or create a new one
    3) This file will be written to the users HOMEDRIVE on first time installation
